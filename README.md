# Traffic-Light-System

A traffic light system utilizing the STM32F4 Discovery board and FreeRTOS, an open source real-time operating system kernal for embedded systems.

Using multiple shift registers, the system simulates one-way traffic approaching an intersection with LEDs. A potentiometer attached to the system governs the speed at which traffic is generated in real-time.
